Summary

Design and build the “Support Wheel of Fate”

Background

At one of our companies, all engineers take turns to support the business for half a day at a time. This is affectionately known as BAU.
Currently, there is no tool which decides who is doing BAU and when, all rotas are created and maintained by hand.

Task

Your task is to design and build an online “Support Wheel of Fate”. This should select two engineers at random to both complete a half day of support each. For the purposes of this task, you are free to assume that we have 10 engineers.

Business Rules

There are some rules and these are liable to change in the future:
An engineer can work at most a half day shift in a day.
Each engineer should have completed one whole day of support in any 2 week period (ignore weekends).
An engineer cannot have half day shifts on consecutive days.

Deliverables

At the end of the task, the following must be included:
A Presentation Layer (ReactJs/React Native)
An API (NodeJs) 

It is also important that you document your decisions as you will be expected to talk through your approach.

Rules

1. You have 3 days to complete the task from the moment it is sent to you.
2. Send it back to us via Git (GitHub, GitLab etc).
3. You are free to use the internet for research, inspiration and help.

Bonus

Deploy the solution on a server (netlify, heroku, aws…)
We love unit tests
